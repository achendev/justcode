# 🚀 Just Code

Just Code is a rapid development tool that bridges the gap between your local development environment and a Large Language Model (LLM) chat interface. It allows you to:

</p>

1.  **Send your entire project's context** to an LLM with a single click.
2.  **Deploy code generated by the LLM** back to your local files with another single click.

This creates a tight feedback loop, making it incredibly fast to iterate on code with AI assistance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system consists of two main components:

*   **🖥️ A Local Flask Server (`app.py`):** This server runs on your machine and acts as the bridge to your filesystem.
    *   `/getcode`: Scans a specified project directory, bundles all relevant source files into a single text block, and formats it as a prompt for the LLM.
    *   `/deploycode`: Receives a shell script from the browser, performs a security validation, and executes it to update your local files.

*   **🧩 Chrome Extension (`chrome_extension/`):** A user-friendly popup interface.
    *   **Popup Interface:** Contains an input for the project path and two buttons: "Get Code" and "Deploy Code".

## ✅ Prerequisites

*   🐍 Python 3.8 or higher
*   📦 `pip` and `venv`
*   🐧 A Unix-like environment (`find`, `xargs`, `tail`, `/bin/bash` are used)
*   🌐 Google Chrome browser

## 🛠️ Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Run these commands:

        git clone https://github.com/achendev/justcode.git
        cd justcode

2.  **Set Up Python Environment**

        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **Create Icon Files for the Extension**
    *   Create three PNG icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels) and place them in `chrome_extension/icons/`.
    *   You can use an online icon generator to create placeholders.

4.  **Load the Chrome Extension**
    *   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable "Developer mode".
    *   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome_extension` folder.

5.  **Grant Clipboard Permission**

    Just Code requires permission to read from and write to your clipboard. This must be enabled manually in the extension's settings.

    **How to enable:**
    1.  In Chrome, go to **Settings**.
    2.  Navigate to **Extensions** on the left menu.
    3.  Find the **JustCode Extension** and click on the **Details** button.
    4.  On the details page, click on **Site settings**.
    5.  Find **Clipboard** in the permissions list and change its value to **Allow**.

    *This is a critical one-time setup step to allow the extension to read the code provided by the LLM.*
 

6.  **Run the Server**

        python app.py

    You should see a message that the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5010`. Keep this terminal open.

## 🔄 Usage Workflow

1.  **Start the Server:** Ensure the local Flask server is running.
2.  **Open Popup:** Click the JustCode extension icon.
3.  **Set Path:** Enter the absolute path to your project.
4.  **Go to LLM:** Navigate to your preferred LLM chat interface.
5.  **Get Code:** Click the `Get Code` button. Your project context will be loaded into the prompt area.
6.  **Prompt LLM:** Add your instructions and submit.
7.  **Get Response:** The LLM will respond with a bash script.
8.  **Deploy Code:** Click the `Deploy Code` button.
9.  **Verify:** Your local files are now updated.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This tool executes code generated by an LLM directly on your machine. This is **not foolproof**.

*   **ALWAYS review the `bash` script** before clicking "Deploy Code". Malicious commands can delete files.
*   This tool is intended for **personal development and rapid prototyping**.
*   **Use at your own risk.**
