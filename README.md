# Just Code
Just Code is a rapid development tool that bridges the gap between your local development environment and a Large Language Model (LLM) chat interface. It allows you to:
1. Send your entire project's context to an LLM with a single click of a bookmarklet or extension button.
2. Deploy the code generated by the LLM back to your local files with another single click.
This creates a tight feedback loop, making it incredibly fast to iterate on code with AI assistance.

## How It Works
The system consists of two main components:
1. A Local Flask Server (app.py): This server runs on your machine and acts as the bridge to your filesystem.
   * /getcode: Scans a specified project directory, bundles all relevant source files into a single text block, and formats it as a prompt for the LLM.
   * /deploycode: Receives a shell script from the browser, performs a security validation to ensure it only modifies files within the project directory, and then executes it to update your local files.
2. Chrome Extension (chrome_extension/): A user-friendly alternative to bookmarklets, providing a popup interface.
   * Popup Interface: Contains a text input for the project path (saved to Chrome's local storage) and two buttons: "Get Code" to fetch project context and "Deploy Code" to execute LLM-generated scripts.
   * Replaces the previous bookmarklet approach with a more robust and user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip and venv
* A Unix-like environment (find, xargs, tail, /bin/bash are used)
* Google Chrome browser

## Setup
1. Clone the Repository
   Run these commands:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/justcode.git
   cd justcode

2. Set Up Python Environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create Icon Files for the Extension
   * Create three PNG icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels) and place them in chrome_extension/icons/ as icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png.
   * You can use any simple image or generate placeholders (e.g., via an online icon generator).

4. Load the Chrome Extension
   * Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
   * Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.
   * Click "Load unpacked" and select the chrome_extension folder from your project directory.
   * The JustCode extension should now appear in your browser.

5. Run the Server
   python app.py
   You should see a message that the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5010. Keep this terminal window open.

## Usage Workflow
1. Make sure your local Flask server is running.
2. Click the JustCode extension icon in Chrome to open the popup.
3. Enter the absolute path to your project in the "Project Path" field (e.g., /Users/yourname/projects/myproject).
4. Navigate to your preferred LLM chat interface (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT).
5. Click the Get Code button in the extension popup. Your project's code will be loaded into the LLM's prompt input area.
6. Add your instructions (e.g., "Add a new feature that does X") and submit the prompt to the LLM.
7. The LLM should respond with a short explanation and a bash code block containing cat and rm commands.
8. Once the response is fully generated, click the Deploy Code button in the extension popup.
9. The script is executed, and your local files are updated. Check the popup's error message area or the browser's developer console for status messages.

## Security Warning
This tool executes code generated by an LLM directly on your machine. While there is a basic safeguard to prevent file writes outside the specified project directory, this is not foolproof.
* ALWAYS review the bash script generated by the LLM before clicking "Deploy Code". Malicious or incorrect commands could delete your files or cause other damage.
* This tool is intended for personal development and rapid prototyping.
* Use at your own risk.
