# 🚀 Just Code

Just Code is a rapid development tool that bridges the gap between your local development environment and a Large Language Model (LLM) chat interface. It allows you to:

</p>

1.  **Send your entire project's context** to an LLM with a single click and prompt your task.
2.  **Deploy code generated by the LLM** in many files back to your local files with another single click.
3.  **Instantly Undo and Redo** any changes that don't work as expected.

This creates a tight, safe, and incredibly fast feedback loop for iterating on code with AI assistance. Because the LLM receives the full context, it can generate scripts that create, modify, and delete dozens of files at once, allowing you to implement complex features with a single deployment.

> **💡 Pro Tip: Recommended LLM**   
> While JustCode can work with many LLMs, it is highly optimized for and tested with **Google AI Studio** using the **Gemini 2.5 Pro** model. Its large context (1 million tokens) window  and strong instruction-following capabilities provide the most reliable results.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system consists of a Chrome Extension that can operate in two different backend modes, which you can select per-profile within the extension:

*   **🖥️ Browser (JS) Backend (Default & Recommended):** This mode runs entirely within your browser. It uses the modern [File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/fs) to directly and safely read your project files and write changes back.
    *   **Pros:** No Python or server setup required. It's the simplest and fastest way to get started.
    *   **Cons:** Requires you to grant permission twice for first project, then sinle per each project folder you want to work with.

*   **🐍 Server Backend:** This optional mode uses a local Flask server (`app.py`) that you run on your machine. The extension communicates with this server to access your filesystem.
    *   **Pros:** Can work with any project path you provide without needing per-folder browser permissions.
    *   **Cons:** Requires Python and leaving a terminal process running in the background.

The **Chrome Extension (`chrome_extension/`)** provides a unified user-friendly interface for both modes, including action buttons, profile management, and settings.

### Shortcuts

*   `Alt + ↑`: Open the extension popup.
*   When the popup is open:
    *   `Alt + ←`: Trigger "Get Context" for the active profile.
    *   `Alt + →`: Trigger "Deploy Code" for the active profile.
    *   `Alt + R`: Trigger "Undo" for the active profile.
    *   `Alt + A`: Switch to the profile tab on the left (loops around).
    *   `Alt + S`: Switch to the profile tab on the right (loops around).
    
> **Note on Shortcuts:** If the `Alt + ↑` shortcut to open the extension doesn't work, you may need to set or reset it. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in your browser, find the "JustCode Extension", and assign your preferred shortcut for the "Open JustCode Popup" action.

## ↩️ Automatic Undo/Redo History

Never fear a bad deployment again. Just Code includes a powerful safety net:

*   **Automatic History:** When you click **Deploy Code**, two scripts are saved:
    1.  The deployment script itself (which becomes the "redo" script).
    2.  An automatically generated "undo" script that perfectly reverses the deployment.
*   **Instant Recovery:** If a deployment produces an undesirable result, simply click the **Undo** button. Your files are instantly restored. Clicked Undo by mistake? Just click **Redo**.
*   **Intelligent History:** The undo/redo history works just like in a text editor. If you undo several changes and then make a *new* deployment, the old "redo" history is cleared, as it no longer applies to the new state of your project.

This feature allows you to experiment and iterate with AI-generated code fearlessly, knowing you can instantly step backward and forward through your changes.

## ✅ Prerequisites

*   🌐 Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser that supports loading unpacked extensions.

**For Server Mode Only:**
*   🐍 Python 3.10 or higher
*   📦 `pip` and `venv` (usually included with Python)
*   🐙 Git (if you want to clone and update the application via `git pull`)

## 🛠️ Setup

### Stage 1: Get the Code

You have two options:

*   **A) Download ZIP (Easiest):**
    1.  Go to the [JustCode GitHub repository](https://github.com/achendev/justcode).
    2.  Click `Code` > `Download ZIP`.
    3.  Unzip the file on your computer.

*   **B) Git Clone (For updates & server mode):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/achendev/justcode.git
    cd justcode
    ```

### Stage 2: Load the Chrome Extension (Required for Both Modes)

1.  **Load the Extension:**
    *   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch (usually in the top-right corner).
    *   Click the **Load unpacked** button.
    *   In the file dialog, select the `chrome_extension` folder located inside your unzipped or cloned `justcode` project directory.

2.  **Pin the Extension & Grant Permissions:**
    *   Click the puzzle piece icon 🧩 in the Chrome toolbar, find **JustCode**, and click the **pin** icon to keep it visible.
    *   The first time you use certain features, the extension will guide you on granting necessary permissions.

### Stage 3: Choose Your Backend

When you open the JustCode popup, you can choose the backend for each profile using the toggle button next to the project location input (a browser icon for JS mode, a server icon for Server mode).

*   **🖱️ To use the Browser (JS) Backend (Default):**
    *   Make sure the browser icon is showing.
    *   Click the "Select Project Folder" button for your profile. This will prompt you to choose a folder. You'll asked to allow edit files, reopen extension and second time you'll have to choose "Allow every visit".

*   **🐍 To use the Server Backend:**
    *   Make sure the server icon is showing.
    *   Follow the OS-specific instructions below to run the server.
    *   In the extension, enter the full, absolute path to your project.

### Running the Server (Optional - Only for Server Backend)

Follow the instructions for your operating system to set up the Python environment and run the server.

#### 🍎 macOS & 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, etc.)

1.  **Configure the Server (Optional)**
    The server listens on `127.0.0.1:5010` by default. You can change this by creating a `.env` file. See the [Server Configuration](#-server-configuration) section for more details.
    ```bash
    # Copy the example config to a new .env file
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now you can edit `.env` to change the host or port.

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    In the `justcode` directory, run:
    ```bash
    # Create a Python virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    With the environment active, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Server**
    You can run the server directly with `python app.py`, or use the provided helper script:
    ```bash
    # Run the server
    ./app.sh
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open. You should see a message confirming the server is running.


#### 🪟 Windows

1.  **Configure the Server (Optional)**
    The server listens on `127.0.0.1:5010` by default. You can change this by creating a `.env` file. See the [Server Configuration](#-server-configuration) section for more details.
    
    In PowerShell or CMD, run:
    ```powershell
    # Copy the example config to a new .env file
    copy .env.example .env
    ```
    Now you can edit `.env` with Notepad or another editor to change the host or port.

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    In the `justcode` directory, open **PowerShell** (recommended) or **Command Prompt (`cmd`)**.

    ```powershell
    # Create a Python virtual environment
    # You may need to use 'py', 'python.exe' or 'python3.exe' if 'python' is not in your PATH
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment in PowerShell
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    > **Note for PowerShell:** If you get an error about script execution being disabled, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` and try activating again.

    > If using the classic **Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)**, activate with this command instead of:
    > `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Once the environment is active (your prompt will be prefixed with `(venv)`), run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Server**
    You can run the server directly with `python app.py`. Alternatively, you can run the provided batch script from your terminal or by double-clicking it in the file explorer.
    ```batch
    .\app.bat
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open. You should see a message confirming the server is running.

## 🔧 Server Configuration

This section applies only if you are using the **Server Backend**. You can configure the server's listening address and port using a `.env` file in the project root.

1.  Copy the example file: `cp .env.example .env` (or `copy .env.example .env` on Windows).
2.  Edit `.env`:
    *   `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: The IP address to bind to.
        *   `127.0.0.1` (Default): Accessible only from your own computer. Debug mode is **ON**.
        *   `0.0.0.0`: Accessible from other devices on your network. **Debug mode is automatically turned OFF for security.**
    *   `FLASK_RUN_PORT`: The port to listen on (e.g., `5010`).

If you change the server URL or port, remember to update it in the extension's profile settings.

## 🗂️ Handling Large Projects: Automatic Context Filtering

LLMs have a context window limit, meaning you can't always send your entire project's source code at once. JustCode has a smart feature to help you manage this.

### Context Size Limit

In each profile's settings (click the ⚙️ button), you can set a **Context Size Limit** in characters. The default is 3,000,000.

### Automatic Exclusion Suggestions

If you click `Get Context` and the tool determines that your project's content exceeds this limit, it won't send the code. Instead, it will do the following:

1.  **Analyze Your Project:** It quickly scans your project's file structure and the size of each file.
2.  **Generate a Smart Prompt:** It sends this file tree analysis to the LLM, asking it to suggest which files and directories should be excluded to shrink the context size. The prompt is specifically designed to identify common non-essential files like `node_modules`, build artifacts, large data files, and logs.
3.  **Receive Exclusion Patterns:** The LLM will respond with a comma-separated list of patterns (e.g., `node_modules/,dist/,*.log`).
4.  **Update and Retry:** You can then copy this list, paste it into your profile's "Exclude Patterns" field, and click `Get Context` again.

This workflow turns the tedious task of manually curating a large project's context into a quick, AI-assisted process.

## 🔄 Usage Workflow

1.  **Select Backend & Location:** Open the JustCode popup (`Alt+↑`). For your profile, choose your desired backend (Browser or Server) and set the project location.
    *   **Browser (JS) Mode:** Click "Select Project Folder" and choose your project's root directory.
    *   **Server Mode:** Ensure the local server is running and enter the absolute path to your project.
2.  **Go to LLM:** Navigate to your preferred LLM chat interface.
3.  **Get Context:** Click the `Get Context` button or press `Alt+←`. Your project's code will be formatted.
4.  **Paste & Prompt:** The context is either copied to your clipboard or pasted directly into your LLM chat interface. Scroll to the **bottom** of the context block and add your task instructions (e.g., "Add a new endpoint called `/status`").
5.  **Submit to LLM:** Send the combined context and your instructions to the model.
6.  **Get Response:** The LLM will analyze your request and respond with a `bash` script.
7.  **Deploy Code:** Click the `Deploy Code` button or press `Alt+→`. The extension will apply the changes to your local files.
8.  **Verify & Iterate:** Check your files. If something is wrong, just click **Undo**!

> **💡 Pro Tip: What if a deployment goes wrong?**   
> If a deployment fails or makes unwanted changes, just click the **Undo** button for that profile. It will instantly restore your files. Clicked Undo by mistake? Click **Redo**!

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This tool executes code generated by an LLM directly on your machine. This is **not foolproof**.

*   **ALWAYS review the `bash` script** before clicking "Deploy Code". Malicious commands can delete files.
*   **An undo/redo history is created automatically**, giving you a way to recover from mistakes, but it's not a substitute for careful review.
*   **This tool is intended for personal development and rapid prototyping**.
*   **Use at your own risk.**
