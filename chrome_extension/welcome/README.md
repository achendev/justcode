## How to Get Started in 8 Simple Steps

1.  ### Go to Your LLM
    Navigate to your favorite AI chat interface. We highly recommend [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) with the Gemini 2.5 Pro model for the best results.

2.  ### Open JustCode
    Click the JustCode icon in your Chrome toolbar. We suggest pinning it for easy access!

3.  ### Select Your Project Folder
    In the "Browser (JS) Mode", click "Select Project Folder". You may need to grant permission **2-3 times** until Chrome offers the **"Allow on every visit"** option. This is a crucial step for persistent access.
    
    *Alternatively, for more advanced control, check out the [Server Mode setup](https://github.com/achendev/justcode#using-server-mode).*

4.  ### Get Context & Add Your Task
    Click **"Get Context"**. This will load your project files into the AI's chat box. Scroll to the bottom and type your task, for example: *"Add a new feature that does X and Y."*

5.  ### Filter Large Projects (If Needed)
    If your project is large, you'll get a prompt to create an "exclude list". Just send this prompt to the AI. It will reply with a list of files to ignore. Copy this list, paste it into the "Exclude Patterns" field in your JustCode profile, and click **"Get Context"** again. You may need to repeat this process a few times to fine-tune your exclusions until the project size is under the limit.
    
    **Tip:** Most projects are 50k-700k tokens. If yours is larger, you likely have unneeded files that should be excluded.

6.  ### Deploy Code
    After the AI generates its response (a bash script), simply click **"Deploy Code"** in the JustCode extension. The changes will be applied directly to your local files.

7.  ### Verify & Undo
    Check the changes in your IDE. If the result isn't what you expected, just click **"Undo"**. Don't be discouraged if it's not perfectâ€”around 15% of AI answers have minor mistakes. Refine your prompt and try again!
